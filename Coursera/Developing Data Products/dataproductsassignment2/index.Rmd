Here I add a map with some nearby pseudorandom locations to my hometown:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(500, min = 43.25, max = 43.35),
                 lng = runif(500, min = -2.00, max = -1.80))
df %>% 
        leaflet() %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
